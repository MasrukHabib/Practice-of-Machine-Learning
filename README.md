A professional machine learning project follows a systematic workflow, including loading the dataset, performing data preprocessing, and then training the model. Hereâ€™s an improved and more professional outline for a typical machine learning project:

Step-by-Step Machine Learning Project Workflow:
Load the Dataset

Data Preprocessing
     Handling Missing Values
     Encoding Categorical Variables
     Feature Scaling

Model Training:
      Split the Data
      Train the Model

Model Evaluation

Visualization of Results
